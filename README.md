I am using Traccar as an integration in Home Assistant to track
the location of two smart phones.

You have to set up an XML file that will be traccar.xml in the config volume.
I keep a copy of the file here but currently not checked into git.

You edit it per instructions here:

I just converted from using the default H2 database, which I know nothing about
to use MySQL, which I actually understand.
